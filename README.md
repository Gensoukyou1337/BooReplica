# boo_replica

A replica of the Boo app's UI using Flutter.

Main points:
1. Some smoke-and-mirrors were definitely involved, like the AppBar being transparent and with its height and the TabBar's height being changed by the state. I would've used a CustomScrollView with SliverAppBars, but this time the ScrollView is inside a PageView.
2. I haven't done the 16 Types/Cognitive Functions/Zodiac section completely because of the data required.
